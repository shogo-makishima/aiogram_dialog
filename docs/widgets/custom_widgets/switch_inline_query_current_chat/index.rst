SwitchInlineQueryCurrentChat
*********************************

SwitchInlineQueryCurrentChat is the same as SwitchInlineQuery, but the inline query is sent from the current chat. May be empty, in which case only the bot's username will be inserted.

This offers a quick way for the user to open your bot in inline mode in the same chat - good for selecting something from multiple options.
